## Introduction

Routing and switching are fundamental concepts in computer networking, forming the backbone of modern communication infrastructure. This repository serves as a showcase for my expertise in these areas and demonstrates my ability to design, configure, and troubleshoot networks using various routing and switching protocols.

The labs included in this repository are designed to provide practical examples of network configurations, protocol implementations, and troubleshooting scenarios. By exploring these labs, you will gain insight into my approach to network design, my understanding of different routing protocols, and my proficiency in configuring and managing network switches.

## Lab Directory

The labs in this repository will contain the following categories:

1. **Basic Routing**: These labs cover the fundamental concepts of IP routing, including static routing, dynamic routing protocols such as OSPF and EIGRP, and routing table manipulation.

2. **Advanced Routing**: In this section, you will find labs that delve deeper into advanced routing topics, including BGP (Border Gateway Protocol), route redistribution, policy-based routing, and route filtering.

3. **Switching**: These labs focus on network switches and their configurations. You will learn about VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks), Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), VLAN trunking, EtherChannel, and switch security.

4. **Network Troubleshooting**: These labs simulate real-world troubleshooting scenarios, enabling you to enhance your diagnostic skills and learn effective troubleshooting techniques for routing and switching issues.

## Usage

To make the most of this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/routing-and-switching.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the specific lab directory you are interested in.

3. Each lab contains detailed documentation and configuration files. Read the lab instructions carefully to understand the objectives, requirements, and steps involved.

4. Use network simulation tools like Cisco Packet Tracer, GNS3, or EVE-NG to recreate the lab environment and perform the configurations.

5. Experiment with the lab configurations, modify parameters, and observe the effects to gain a deeper understanding of the concepts and protocols being demonstrated.

6. Feel free to customize and extend the labs to further enhance your learning experience. Add new scenarios, incorporate different protocols, or experiment with alternative configurations.
